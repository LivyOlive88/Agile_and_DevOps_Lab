Flight Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project challenges you to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting flight fares based on key travel and airline information. You will apply the full data science workflow, from problem framing and data cleaning to model training, evaluation, and optimization.

You'll work independently to design, structure, and implement each step of the pipeline while documenting your process and results.

Project Objectives
Problem Framing: Define a business question and translate it into a machine learning regression problem.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Prepare and preprocess real-world flight price data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore and visualize trends in airline fares, routes, and seasonal pricing.

Model Development: Build and evaluate multiple regression models to predict total fare.

Model Optimization: Apply hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and cross-validation to improve model accuracy.

Model Interpretation: Explain feature importance and interpret what drives fare variations.

Insights & Reporting: Present findings through visualizations and structured documentation.

Project Steps
Step 1: Problem Definition & Data Understanding
1. Understand the business goal

Airlines and travel platforms want to estimate ticket prices based on route, airline, and travel date to help with pricing strategy and dynamic recommendations.

2. Define the ML task

Type: Supervised Regression

Target variable: Total Fare

Features: Airline, Source, Destination, Date, Base Fare, Tax & Surcharge, etc.

3. Load the dataset

Use Flight_Price_Dataset_of_Bangladesh.csv (available on Kaggle).

Inspect the structure using pandas (.info(), .describe(), .head()).

4. Initial observations

Note missing data, outliers, categorical columns, and numerical ranges.

Document assumptions and limitations.

Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
A. Cleaning Data

Drop irrelevant or duplicate columns if present (e.g., "Unnamed", "Index").

Handle missing values:

Numerical: Impute using mean/median or drop rows with excessive missingness.

Categorical: Impute with "Unknown" or mode.

Correct invalid entries:

Negative fares or base fares → replace or remove.

Inconsistent city names → normalize (e.g., "Dhaka", "Dacca").

Validate data types:

Convert numeric columns (Base Fare, Tax & Surcharge, Total Fare) to float.

Convert date columns to datetime.

B. Feature Engineering

Create new features:

Total Fare = Base Fare + Tax & Surcharge (if missing).

Month, Day, Weekday, and Season from Date.

Encode categorical variables:

Use One-Hot Encoding (pd.get_dummies) or Label Encoding for Airline, Source, and Destination.

Scale numerical features:

Apply StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler for models sensitive to scale (e.g., regression).

Split data:

Train-test split (e.g., 80/20) using train_test_split().

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Descriptive Statistics

Summarize fares by airline, source, destination, and season.

Check for correlations among numerical features.

2. Visual Analysis

Plot distributions of fares, base fares, and taxes.

Use boxplots to show fare variation across airlines.

Plot average fare by month or season.

Correlation heatmap to detect multicollinearity.

3. KPI Exploration

Average fare per airline.

Most popular route (highest flight frequency).

Seasonal fare variation (e.g., Eid, winter).

Top 5 most expensive routes.

Step 4: Model Development (Baseline)
1. Model Selection

Start with Linear Regression as a baseline.

2. Implementation

Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Evaluate using:

$R^{2}$ (coefficient of determination)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

3. Interpretation

Visualize actual vs. predicted values.

Analyze residuals to detect underfitting or overfitting.

Document key findings.

Step 5: Advanced Modeling & Optimization
1. Try Multiple Models

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosted Trees (optional advanced step)

2. Model Tuning

Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters.

Compare models using cross-validation results.

3. Model Evaluation

Summarize results in a comparison table:

Model R2 MAE  RMSE

Identify the best model balancing accuracy and simplicity.

4. Regularization & Bias-Variance

Demonstrate how Ridge and Lasso affect overfitting.

Plot bias-variance tradeoff.

Step 6: Model Interpretation & Insights
1. Feature Importance

For linear models: Examine coefficients.

For tree-based models: Plot feature importances.

2. Insights

What factors most influence fare prices?

How do airlines differ in pricing strategy?

Do certain seasons or routes consistently show higher fares?

3. Communication

Summarize results for non-technical stakeholders.

Include clear, data-backed recommendations.
